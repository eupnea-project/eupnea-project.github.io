# Optional features

## Install to internal storage

This will wipe ChromeOS(or any other installed OS) from the internal drive. It will always be possible
to [restore ChromeOS using a recovery USB](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595?hl=en) afterwards.

It's recommended to [set up audio](/docs/depthboot/audio) and confirm all hardware is working correctly(touchpad,
touchscreen, speakers) before proceeding.

To install to internal storage, run: ``install-to-internal`` in a terminal.

## Fan control(ectool):
